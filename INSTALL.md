1. Paste these lines into the shell. This will install Raylib, Raygui, and Yojson the libraries we used. If on Windows, do this from WSL2 shell (Ubuntu):

    ```
    opam install raylib
    ```
    ```
    opam install raygui
    ```
    ```
    opam install yojson
    ```

2. Make sure you've cloned the repository and navigated to the MTD directory.
Then, run this command to start up the game:
    ```
    make mtd
    ```
